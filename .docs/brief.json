  "created": "2025-12-13",
  "project": "37-pencils",
  "mode": "LEARNING",

  "rationale": "A personal digital garden that prioritizes the joy of building over conventional blog structure. Ideas grow and interconnect through backlinks and semantic search. The process of creation is as important as the result.",

  "problem": {
    "statement": "Traditional blog platforms produce predictable, templated experiences with no connective tissue between ideas. The building process itself is uninspiring, and the chronological structure doesn't serve how thoughts actually develop and relate to each other.",
    "impact": [
      "Ideas remain siloed and don't surface when relevant",
      "The creative process of building is reduced to filling in templates",
      "Readers (including the author) can't explore connections between thoughts"
    ]
  },

  "goals": {
    "primary": "Build a personal digital garden that's as interesting to create as it is to explore, with interconnected ideas and non-linear navigation.",
    "secondary": [
      "Learn new technologies through hands-on implementation",
      "Create a space for quick observations, tangents, and curiosities",
      "Implement bidirectional linking and semantic search",
      "Document the AI-assisted development journey as content",
      "Occasionally showcase photography from a 55-year personal archive"
    ]
  },

  "features": [
    {
      "name": "Digital Garden Structure",

    {
      "name": "Bidirectional Links",
      "description": "Wiki-style linking where mentioning concepts automatically surfaces connections to other posts. Backlinks shown on each post.",

    },
    {
      "name": "Image Hosting",

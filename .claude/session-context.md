## Project Summary

**37 Pencils** (37pencils.net) is a personal digital garden - not a traditional blog, but an interconnected space where ideas grow and link to each other.

### Core Concept
- **Digital Garden philosophy** over chronological blog
- **Bidirectional links** connecting posts wiki-style
- **Semantic search** to surface connections
- **Growth states**: seedling (private) → growing → evergreen
- **Brutalism-Lite aesthetic** - bold without being inaccessible
- **Schott's Miscellany tone** - wry, bemused, curious, not pretentious

### Content Types
- Quick observations and tangents (primary)
- AI/LLM-assisted development discoveries (meta-journey)
- Photography from 55-year personal archive (occasional)
- Music, curiosities, links (miscellany)

### Technical Context
- **Mode**: LEARNING (journey matters as much as destination)
- **Implementation**: Claude Code as primary implementor
- **Deployment**: Public, Cloudflare, 37pencils.net (domain owned)
- **Timeline**: Open-ended passion project

### v1 Scope
**Must-have:**
- Digital garden structure with growth states
- Bidirectional links / backlinks
- Semantic search
- Draft/seedling states (private until ready)
- Image hosting (direct, optimized)
- Brutalism-Lite aesthetic
- About page with contact

**Deferred (post-v1):**
- Scrollytelling (investigate fit)
- Automation windows (RSS, activity feeds)
- Comments/interaction

### Name Origin
"37 Pencils" comes from an absurdist political moment (Trump, Dec 2025), reclaimed to mean: thoughts go off on weird tangents, and that's where the interesting stuff lives.

## Key Decisions Made

- Learning mode selected (full exploration of trade-offs)
- Digital Garden over traditional blog structure
- Bidirectional links + semantic search as core features (ambitious but worth it)
- Photography hosted directly on site (occasional element, not focus)
- Low-key personal presence (about page only, no personal brand exercise)
- No comments/interaction - one-way broadcast with contact method
- **Architecture**: SSG approach, Markdown-in-Git, [[wikilinks]] syntax (all LOCKED)
- **Tech Stack**: Astro 4.x + Tailwind CSS + Pagefind (search) + custom Remark plugins (backlinks)

## Notes

- User is 71, intellectually curious, "fearlessness with training wheels"
- Has parallel project: notetaking/second brain app with semantic search + backlinking (related learning)
- Touchstone for tone: Schott's Original Miscellany
- Touchstone for structure: Maggie Appleton's digital garden philosophy

## Next Steps

1. Invoke `deployment-advisor` to decide hosting (Cloudflare Pages vs VPS)
2. Then proceed to `project-spinup` to generate project foundation

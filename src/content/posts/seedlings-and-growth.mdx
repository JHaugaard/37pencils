Every post in this garden has a growth state:

**Seedling** - Fresh, rough, possibly half-baked. These are ideas I'm still chewing on. They might be wrong. They might be incomplete. That's fine.

**Growing** - Has some substance. I've thought about it more, maybe revised it. Still evolving.

**Evergreen** - Relatively stable. I'm happy with it. Doesn't mean it won't change - everything's open to revision - but it's reached a certain maturity.

This post is "growing" because I'm still figuring out exactly how I want to use these states. Do I show all three publicly? Only hide seedlings? The [[why-digital-gardens|philosophy]] suggests transparency, but maybe not everything needs to be visible.

Something to think about: status should probably indicate confidence, not completeness.

import Figure from '../../components/Figure.astro';
import sampleImage from '../../assets/images/sample-garden.jpg';

A rough idea I'm playing with:

What if the process of building this site is itself part of the content? Not just the finished garden, but the decisions, dead ends, and discoveries along the way.

Questions I'm sitting with:
- How much meta-commentary is too much?
- Does showing the work diminish the work?
- What's the line between sharing process and navel-gazing?

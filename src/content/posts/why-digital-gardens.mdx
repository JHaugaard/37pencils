Traditional blogs are newspapers. Reverse-chronological. Finished pieces. Published and done.

Digital gardens are different. They're more like... actual gardens. Ideas get planted as [[seedlings-and-growth]], tended over time, and allowed to grow sideways into unexpected connections.

The thing I love about this approach:

1. **Permission to be unfinished.** Not everything needs to be polished. Some of the most interesting ideas are half-formed.

2. **Connections surface over time.** When you [[building-in-public|build in public]], patterns emerge that you couldn't have planned.

3. **No pressure for freshness.** A great thought from 2019 is just as valuable as one from today.

This garden exists because I wanted a place where thoughts could go off on weird tangents - and that's where the interesting stuff lives.
